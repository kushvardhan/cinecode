CineCode — MASTER PLAN (for Augment / GPT-5 / Claude / V0.dev / Cursor)
====================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Project: CineCode — a next-gen cinematic creative agency website.
Goal: world-class, ultra-minimal, cinematic, motion-first site built in Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion + React-Three-Fiber.
Audience: Clients who expect premium UX, filmic motion, and flawless responsiveness.

- then proceed to the next task

AI TOOL CHOICES (Recommended for Augment free tier)
--------------------------------------------------
Pick the highest-capability model available in Augment. If Augment exposes GPT-5, use it. If not, use the best available (gpt-4o / gpt-4o-mini). Use additional tools as follows:

1. **GPT-5 (or the best available high-capability model in Augment)** — Primary engine for:
   - Full project scaffolding
   - Production-ready Next.js TypeScript code
   - Motion + Three.js + Framer Motion + GSAP code
   - API routes, db utils, and deployment scripts

2. **Claude Sonnet 4.5** — Creative direction and copy:
   - Cinematic microcopy, case-study narratives, story beats
   - Motion storytelling instructions (camera terms, beats)
   - Tone, hero taglines, CTA variants

3. **V0.dev** — Rapid UI component generation:
   - Pixel-correct Tailwind components (cards, forms, grids)
   - Useful for quick visual variants to swap into the codebase

4. **Cursor (or Augment’s repo-editing agent)** — apply patches directly to repo:
   - Create/modify files, run installs, open dev server, fix compile errors
   - Best for “no copy/paste” execution

5. **Framer (Figma) + Figma** — design & motion spec handoff:
   - Build visual prototypes, export Lottie and motion specs

FALLBACK RULE:
- If GPT-5 not available, pick best available (gpt-4o). Always use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for creative text when available.

TOP-LEVEL PRINCIPLES (Must be enforced)
---------------------------------------
- Keep homepage minimal: small headline, single line subline, 2 CTAs, cinematic hero.
- Each section MUST feel like a film-beat: introduction → reveal → payoff.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` globally.
- Lazy-load heavy libs (three, gsap) using dynamic imports in client components ONLY.
- Keep initial (critical) JS low. Target: **≤ 250 KB** preload JS for first paint.
- Provide fallback poster images or HeroLite for low-end devices.
- Add a “Motion Intensity” control (Low/Medium/High/Off) in user settings.
- Accessibility: keyboard-first navigation, visible focus, contrast, alt tags.

STRUCTURE (High-level IA)
-------------------------
Pages:
- / (Home) — Hero, Services preview, Projects preview, About teaser, Contact CTA
- /about
- /services/[slug]
- /projects/[slug]
- /team
- /contact
- /dashboard (auth gated)
- /api/* (contact, projects, auth hooks)

Components (must implement):
- ThreeHero.tsx (client-only, R3F low-poly glyph mesh)
- HeroLite.tsx (fallback, image poster)
- HeroWrapper.tsx (client component that chooses R3F or HeroLite)
- ServiceCard.tsx (interactive)
- ProjectCard.tsx (video-led preview)
- ProcessTimeline.tsx (animated timeline)
- TeamCard.tsx (portrait-focused)
- MotionWrappers.tsx (prefers-reduced-motion aware wrappers)
- UI primitives: Button, Icon, Modal, FormField, GradientText

LIBS / DEPENDENCIES (confirmed)
-------------------------------
- Next.js (16.x App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- framer-motion
- gsap (load only when necessary)
- @studio-freight/lenis (smooth scroll)
- three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei
- next-seo
- @clerk/nextjs or next-auth
- mongoose (or Prisma + Postgres if needed)
- zod + react-hook-form
- rate-limiter-flexible, helmet, xss-clean
- lucide-react (icons) / custom svgs
- @vercel/analytics

FONTS & TYPOGRAPHY (hero-worthy)
--------------------------------
You said you like Sheriyans hero font. Exact font may be commercial. Recommended approach:

Primary Display (hero & headings)
- Preferred (commercial): **Neue Montreal** (if you license it)
- Free alternatives:
  - **Space Grotesk** (Google Fonts - nice cinematic feel)
  - **Poppins** / **Montserrat Alternates** (clean, geometric)
  - **Satoshi** (if available and licensed) — use as a display if you can obtain.

Body (readable)
- **Inter** (variable, performant, readable)
- or **Roboto / System UI** fallback

Font usage:
- Use variable fonts to reduce requests (e.g., Inter Variable)
- Preload hero font with `rel="preload"` in head for LCP
- Provide `font-display: swap` as fallback

COLOR PALETTE & TOKENS
----------------------
- Base dark: `#050507` (almost black)
- Off-white: `#F3F4F6`
- Accent gradient 1 (gold → warm): `#FFD66B → #E8A000`
- Accent gradient 2 (cyan): `#00FFF0 → #00B8D4`
- Accent gradient 3 (purple): `#C084FC → #7C3AED`

Tailwind tokens: set as CSS variables in `globals.css`:
 





 i want every section to be like the best and perfect UX to the client and user that made them shock and startstuck by how good, artisitic, creative, animated , scrolling effect smooth the website is , EACH AND EVERY SECTION SHOULD BE LIKE THE BEST STORYTELLING LIKE so that it gives the best UX . 
Feel cinematic, smooth, and ultra-minimalist
Have subtle camera-like transitions and micro-interactions on hover, scroll, and click.

Use motion storytelling, not static UI.

Feel alive and interactive, as if it’s part of a short film.
Be highly responsive (mobile-first but luxurious on large screens).

Avoid common layouts like JankiInfotech.com or rahulkumarci.framer.ai — it should feel completely original and futuristic.          IT SHOULD NOT LOOK LIKE EVERY OTHER WEBSITE THAT IS BEING MADE BY AI , COLLECT ALL THE DATA AND ANALYZE ALL THE TOP AND BEST WEBSITE TO MAKE THIS . 
Take light inspiration from Sheriyans Coding School’s website, but focus on sleek cinematic storytelling rather than education.(BY HOW MINIMAL AND COOL AND BEST IT LOOKS) 
Include smooth scroll-based reveals, magnetic buttons, floating text reveals, lens-blur transitions, and GSAP motion effects.

Structure the pages as:

Hero section — dynamic 3D text or subtle motion parallax showing “CineCode: Crafting Digital Experiences Like Cinema.”

What We Do — Interactive service cards with subtle hover depth.

Projects — Cinematic showcase grid with on-scroll zoom & motion.

Our Process — Stepwise animated journey section.

Team / About Us — Minimal, portrait-focused, with fade-up effects.

Contact CTA — Futuristic form with magnetic hover & floating submit button.     

You are a world-class cinematic UI/UX creative director. Design a full website concept for "CineCode" — a creative agency offering Web & App Development, UI/UX, Video Editing, Digital Marketing, SEO, and GMB optimization.
Requirements:
- Tone: minimalist, cinematic, premium, modern.
- Core needs: Hero (3D/light cinematic scene), Services, Case Studies (video-led), Process (animated timeline), Team (names+roles for each service), Client Portal (post-login).
- Motion language: smooth camera-like transitions, magnetic buttons, scroll-driven reveals, micro-interactions; provide easing, duration, and stagger values.
- Accessibility: include Reduce Motion toggle & keyboard navigation.
- SEO: provide per-page metadata strategy, og:image generation approach, schema.org types.
- Deliverables: high-level IA (pages), component list, 3 hero concepts, color palette, typography scale, 6 UI components with animation specs, and 4 case study layouts (with storytelling beats).
- Constraints: no janky scroll, minimal JS on initial load, respect performance budgets (max 250KB preload JS ideally). Provide fallback for low-end devices.
Also analyze these reference sites (do not copy): https://jankiinfotech.com/ , https://rahulkumarci.framer.ai . Produce a design that is distinctly different — more cinematic, less template.
Output: give a Figma-ready spec (components, tokens, motion styles) and a short narrative for each section.        
You are an expert Next.js developer. Generate a production-ready implementation plan + starter code for CineCode using:
- Next.js App Router with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion, Lenis (smooth scroll), GSAP (scroll only if needed), React Three Fiber for 3D
- Auth: Clerk or NextAuth; Database: Prisma + PostgreSQL (recommendation)
Requirements:
1. Provide folder structure and code templates for Home (Hero + Services + Projects + Contact), Team pages (with person assigned for each service), and a secure client portal (dashboard).
2. Provide a client-only Three.js React component for the Hero (dynamic import with SSR off), with performance tips and a fallback image.
3. Show how to wire `next-seo` and schema.org for Service and Person pages.
4. Provide sample Tailwind tokens and motion utility functions (easing + durations).
5. Show how to lazy-load heavy libs, set up CSP, Helmet, rate limiter for API routes, and image optimization strategy.
6. Output: code snippets for `components/ThreeHero.tsx`, `app/page.tsx` hero usage, `lib/motion.ts`, and `next-seo` metadata example.
Constraints: Optimize for Core Web Vitals, respect `prefers-reduced-motion`, and include testing hooks for visual regression.           
Keep the homepage ultra-minimal yet emotionally powerful — like a movie intro.
The focus should be motion, mood, and clarity, not text overload.

✅ Suggested Homepage Layout:

Hero Section (Main Scene):

Cinematic tagline (e.g., “Cinematic. Creative. Code.”)

Light motion background (Three.js particle / floating mesh) 

ineCode — Cinematic Website Concept

Tagline: “Crafting Digital Experiences Like Cinema.”
Essence: Motion. Depth. Silence. Impact.
Design Philosophy: Every frame should feel directed, not just designed.    

PROVIDE ME A .TXT FILES EXPLANING ALL THESE THINGS AND WHICH AI SHOULD I USE FOR ALL THESE THINGS IN AUGMENT FREE TIER ? 
AND IN THE .TXT EVERY SINGLE THING SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT AFTER COMPLETING THE TASK IT CHECK THE TXT FILE FOR THE REMINDER TO MAKE A MASTER CLASS WEBSITE , AND GPT PROVIDE ME THE DATA  AND FONTS TO USE TOO. I LIKE THE HERO SECTION OF THE "https://www.sheryians.com/ " FONT. also make sure THE UI UX should be good
